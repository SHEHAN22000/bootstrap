                    <h1>Cyberpunk 2077</h1>

                    <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt.
                        Set in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe, players assume the role of a customisable 
                        mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat. 
                        The main story follows V's struggle as he deals with a mysterious cybernetic implant that threatens to overwrite 
                        his body with the personality and memories of a deceased celebrity only perceived by V; the two must work together
                        to be separated and save V's life.</p>
            
                    <p>The game's development began following the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016). 
                        The game was developed by a team of around 500 people using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched a new
                        division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production.
                        Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score 
                    was led by Marcin Przybyłowicz, featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.</p>
